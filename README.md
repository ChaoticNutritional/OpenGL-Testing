# OpenGL-Testing

I made this project to document and take notes on my exploration of using native OpenGL with C++. I have also done my best to include any notes and analogies that have helped me better understand the OpenGL library in text files as well as explanations of various functions within the code as comments. Hopefully this serves as a roadmap of my thought process throughout this endeavor.
